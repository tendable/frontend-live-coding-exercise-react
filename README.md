# Tendable Coding Assessment

## Usage

```sh
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Goal

Complete the provided React program to ask a series of Yes/No questions.

## Requirements

The user should be able to select "Yes" or "No" to each question.

After _each_ run the program should calculate and show a rating.

The calculation for the rating is: `100 * number of yes answers / number of questions`.

Extension:
The answers should be **persisted** in local storage.

The program should also show an average rating for all runs.
